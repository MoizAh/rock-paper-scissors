V1: This is the Rock, Paper, Scissors project from the Foundations path on The Odin Project.

V2: This version of the Rock, Paper, Scissors project consists of a front-end that outputs results for the user to see. The page has a scoreboard and stops when one of the users reaches 5 points. I have added a Reset button to allow users to restart the game, or they can refresh the page.
